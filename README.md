# Marble
Hello, I'm Alex, Marble's owner.  

If Marble is in trouble, [call me](tel:+12063300555)  

Marble is allowed outside. Marble has a cat door and a shelter available at all times. He is fed regularly and is great at keeping the alley rats population down. He has an AirTag on his collar and I bring him inside during extreme weather.  

Please don't feed him or let him into your house so he keeps going home.

# History
Marble was born in 2015 at my parents' home in Utah. He has lived in Washington, Virginia, and Chicago.  
Marble has lived in Chicago since 2018.  
In June 2025, Marble had emergency surgery for bladder stones. He has a special diet to prevent bladder stones from returning.
